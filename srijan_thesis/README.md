## Work to be done going forward:
1) Reproduce results of [admetSAR](http://lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/admetsar2/) and [pkCSM](http://biosig.unimelb.edu.au/pkcsm/)<br/>
2) Combine data of admetSAR with the data collected here and train models to see if the results of admetSAR can be improved (USE THE SAME TEST DATASET, AS USED IN admetSAR!)

0,ACTIVATOR,"Positively effects the normal functioning of the protein e.g., activation of an enzyme or cleaving a clotting protein precursor",POSITIVE MODULATOR
1,AGONIST,"Binds to and activates a receptor, often mimicking the effect of the endogenous ligand",POSITIVE MODULATOR
2,ALLOSTERIC ANTAGONIST,Binds to a receptor at an allosteric site and prevents activation by a positive allosteric modulator at that site,NEGATIVE MODULATOR
3,ANTAGONIST,Binds to a receptor and prevents activation by an agonist through competing for the binding site,NEGATIVE MODULATOR
4,ANTISENSE INHIBITOR,Prevents translation of a complementary mRNA sequence through binding to it,NEGATIVE MODULATOR
5,BINDING AGENT,"Binds to a substance such as a cell surface antigen, targetting a drug to that location, but not necessarily affecting the functioning of the substance itself",OTHER
6,BLOCKER,"Negatively effects the normal functioning of an ion channel e.g., prevents or reduces transport of ions through the channel",NEGATIVE MODULATOR
7,CHELATING AGENT,"Binds to a metal, reducing its availability for further interactions",OTHER
8,CROSS-LINKING AGENT,Induces cross-linking of proteins or nucleic acids,OTHER
9,DEGRADER,"Binds to or antagonizes a receptor, leading to its degradation",NEGATIVE MODULATOR
